(originally just a simple currency-resource managing server)
Server code for an open-source 4X space exploration game.

Most of the code here is just managing data transfer between server and client and to a database.
The server will also update the game world under a synchronous tick-based system.

Data is exposed to the client through an HTTP API, and clients may post data as well.
